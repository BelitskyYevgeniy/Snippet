# Snippet

Actual branch is master

## P.S.  
Please, check branch [authentication](https://github.com/BelitskyYevgeniy/Snippet/tree/authentication).  
If we made authentication at the frontend we would use this branch.  
There are created AuthenticationService, configured Auth0 for WebAPI, changed  provider and created services to use AuthenticationService and handled user accessibility to endpoints and data.
